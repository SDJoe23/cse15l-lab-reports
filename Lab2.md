## Part 1: ChatServer Interactions

Welcome to Lab Report 2, where we dive into the intricacies of our `ChatServer`'s interactions, tracking the flow of messages and observing the underlying mechanics of our Java server in action.

### Code 
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
class ChatHandler implements URLHandler {
    // The state of the server: a StringBuilder to accumulate chat messages
    StringBuilder chatHistory = new StringBuilder();

    public String handleRequest(URI url) {
        if (url.getPath().equals("/")) {
            return chatHistory.length() == 0 ? "No messages yet." : chatHistory.toString();
        } else if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {
            String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("&");
            String user = null;
            String message = null;
            for (String param : parameters) {
                String[] keyValue = param.split("=");
                if (keyValue[0].equals("user")) {
                    user = keyValue[1];
                } else if (keyValue[0].equals("s")) {
                    message = keyValue[1];
                }
            }

            if (user != null && message != null) {
                chatHistory.append(user).append(": ").append(message).append("\n");
                return chatHistory.toString(); // Return the updated chat history
            } else {
                return "Invalid request. User and message parameters are required.";
            }
        } else {
            return "404 Not Found!";
        }
    }
}
class ChatServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        Server.start(port, new ChatHandler());
    }
}
```
I'm also using `Server.java`, which is provided in previous labs. After I run following code
```
josephwhiteman@Josephs-MacBook-Pro-3 ~/wavelet $ javac Server.java ChatServer.java
josephwhiteman@Josephs-MacBook-Pro-3 ~/wavelet $ java ChatServer 4000
Server Started!
```




### Interaction 1: jpolitz's Greeting
After I launched my ChatServer on port 4000, the first user, jpolitz, sent a greeting:


- **URL Accessed**: `/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz`
- **Method Called**: My `handleRequest(URI url)` method in the `Handler` class got to work.
- **Arguments I Handled**: I passed the `handleRequest` method a `URI url` with the value `new URI("/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz")`.
- **Changes in My Fields**: My `chatMessages` string, initially an empty canvas, now captured "jpolitz: Hello\n".

### Interaction 2: yash's Question
Not long after, yash joined the chat, adding to the conversation:


- **URL Accessed**: `/add-message?s=How are you&user=yash`
- **Method Called**: Once more, `handleRequest(URI url)` in my `Handler` class was up for the task.
- **Arguments I Handled**: The `URI url` was provided with `new URI("/add-message?s=How are you&user=yash")`.
- **Changes in My Fields**: My `chatMessages` string now included "jpolitz: Hello\nyash: How are you\n".




In each of these exchanges, the `handleRequest` method diligently parses the incoming request's URL, teases apart the user and message details, and meticulously updates the `chatMessages` field to reflect the ongoing conversation. This field acts as a living record, charting the ebb and flow of our server's dialogues.

## Part 2: SSH Key Management and Remote Access

### Generating SSH Keys

- I started by opening a terminal on my system and running the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new pair of SSH keys.During the process, I was prompted to specify the file location for the keys. I chose to save them in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` for the private key and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` for the public key).I decided to skip setting a passphrase for simplicity, though it's an option for additional security.The command successfully created my identification and public key, displaying the key's fingerprint and a randomart image for visual identification of the key.


### Locating the SSH Keys

- Next, I wanted to confirm the existence and location of my newly generated SSH keys.I used the `ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa` command to display details about my private key, confirming its presence in my `.ssh` directory. I also ran `ls -l ~/.ssh/` to list all files in my `.ssh` directory, where I found the `id_rsa` (private key), `id_rsa.pub` (public key), and the `known_hosts` file.


### Copying Public Key to Remote Server

- With my public key ready, I used the `scp` command to securely copy it to the `authorized_keys` file on the remote server (ieng6 in this case).After entering my password, the public key was successfully transferred to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.


### SSH into Remote Server Without a Password

- Finally, I tested SSH access to the ieng6 server using my newly set up SSH keys.I ran `ssh Jwhiteman@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and was able to log in without being prompted for a password, thanks to the SSH key authentication.Upon logging in, I was greeted with the server's welcome message and some system status information.


## Part 3: Learning Outcomes from Recent Labs
In these pastÂ labs, I learnt how to set up and maintain a Java-based chat server on a remote server. This includes an understanding of how many users can talk with the server at the same time. I also had practical experience using SSH keys for secure and convenient remote server access, eliminating the need for password authentication. This knowledge is useful for effectively and securely administering remote servers and applications.
